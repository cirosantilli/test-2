          <p>Crazy projects that I really want to do and which could change the world:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/write-free-science-books-to-get-famous-website">free books website</a> Innovative creator and content metrics to make people write good free science books. So that people can have more fun, and reach <a href="#sci-fi">unconditional basic income faster</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/gpu-robot-vision-simulation-full-ai">https://github.com/cirosantilli/gpu-robot-vision-simulation-full-ai</a>. Games / simplified robotics simulations that provide interesting testbeds for reinforcement learning. To serve as a testing ground for <a href="#sci-fi">AGI</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other general interests areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>low-level, performance critical technologies that increase humanity’s computational capacity: operating systems, GPUs, integrated circuit design, compilers, network programming,  databases, file systems, cryptography, virtualization, optimization, numerical analysis, … The final goal of all of those for me is <a href="#sci-fi">silicon AGI</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I’ll try to get my kids into because I don’t have enough time in this life:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/awesome-whole-cell-simulation">https://github.com/cirosantilli/awesome-whole-cell-simulation</a>. It’s weird, cells feel a lot like embedded systems: small, complex and profound. To reach both <a href="#sci-fi">biological AGI</a> and <a href="#sci-fi">immortality</a>. Especially excited about: cell biology and simulations, cell metabolism, microscopy, analytical chemistry (mass spectroscopy), DNA sequencing, DNA synthesis, synthetic biology, protein and small molecule simulation.</p>

    <p>It saddens me that I’ll die and humanity won’t have understood the brain, maybe not even a measly E. Coli…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I really like open source. It gives more opportunities to the poor countries, and reduces lock-in to my current employer. Shame it is not always economically feasible…</p>

<p>I can speak <a href="/skills#natural-languages">a few languages</a> but I strongly prefer to produce content (code, documentation, reports) in English, since it is more productive to the world as a whole. I don’t mind speaking other languages at the office however.</p>

<p>I’m not a big fan of working remotely, because you don’t feel people’s love as strongly, and usefulness is built on love. But please, give me a small silent office so I can concentrate instead of a silly open space, and create an internal social network so I can see what others are doing. Remote working can only be attempted if the majority of the team also does it, otherwise you will get excluded. Maybe after VR…</p>

<p>For large resources, I prefer textual information (e.g. wikis, issue trackers) over non-textual (e.g. videos, meetings), because it is cheaper to make, modify, searchable, often more precise, and takes less disk space and bandwidth. A sequence of well chosen images is better than any video. Videos must be short and juicy, just to share the love.</p>

<p>I am also interested in academia. I like to teach (people who want to learn) and produce optimal learning material.</p>

<p>I can’t stand crappy tools and documentation. If you have crappy tools, I will end up fixing those tools instead of doing what you tell me to do. Which might lead to me quitting because I can’t stand the tools, or you firing me because I’m not doing the job you think I should be doing.</p>

<p>If our interests coincide, ping me even if you don’t have an specific proposal immediately. I want to know that you exist :-)</p>

<h2 id="why-i-am-interested-in-those-things">Why I am interested in those things</h2>

<p>I am bewildered by the beauty of mathematics, science and engineering.</p>

<p>I almost went into theoretical mathematics or physics just for the beauty of it, but then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got tired of seeing people begging on the streets every day and not doing anything about it</li>
  <li>it was so hard to find good and free sources to learn maths and physics, even if you wanted to learn</li>
  <li>the current educational system gives you very little choice or motivation to learn useful fun stuff</li>
  <li>I found out that programming and applied mathematics were fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>So I decided to devote myself to applied stuff in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make society richer, so that people will have more free time to do fun stuff!</li>
  <li>better organize information and information generation methods so information can be free</li>
  <li>destroy the current educational system and replace it by one that lets people choose what they want to learn</li>
  <li>still have some fun myself!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sci-fi">Sci-fi</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income">Unconditional basic income</a> is my ultimate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism">non-transhumanist</a> dream: to reach a state of technological advancement and distribution of resources so high that everyone gets money for doing nothing, enough for:</p>

<ul>
  <li>basic survival needs: food, housing, clothes, hygiene, etc.</li>
  <li>two children to keep the world going. Or immortality tech, but I think that is harder and borderline transhumanist :-)</li>
  <li>high speed computer and Internet</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a person has that, they can learn, teach and create whatever they want. Or play video games all day long if they wish.</p>

<p>I don’t think I will live to see this, so I content myself with helping it happen faster by increasing the efficiency of the world as I can.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_pilots">Wikipedia list of pilot projects</a>.</p>

<p>Technologies which would help a lot towards unconditional basic income and might be required but which I don’t think I will live to see:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">Artificial general intelligence</a> (AGI).</p>

    <p>Given enough computational power per dollar, I believe AGI is inevitable.</p>

    <p>Either:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>silicon based. Would be faster to achieve, but I’m not sure will ever happen given the end of Moore’s Law</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>genetically modified biological brains + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat">brain in a vat</a>.</p>

        <p>Imagine a brain the size of a building, perfectly engineered to solve certain engineering problems, and giving hints to human operators + taking feedback from cameras and audio attached to the operators.</p>

        <p>This likely implies transhumanism, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading">mind uploading</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>affordable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot">humanoid robots</a> with human-like energy efficiency and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-to-weight_ratio">power-to-weight ratio</a>.</p>

    <p>But I feel that this is even less likely than AGI, since I’m alive at the end of silicon Moore’s law and at the start of the Genome’s Moore’s law: information doubles, small sizes halve, but macroscopic mechanical artifacts stay the same.</p>

    <p>I’m pretty certain about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface">brain–computer interfaces</a>, in particular <a href="https://github.com/cirosantilli/essays/blob/7e1147daeb941a95b96b099d0db0474db25116ea/questions-for-my-future-self.md">full BCI as defined here</a>. Post my life time however.</p>

    <p>So in the worst case we can just grow brainless bodies and replace the cavity hole with a computer that controls the body, possibly with high level decisions coming from a remote building-sized genetically engineered biological AGI brain.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, it is all about costs. A human costs about <a href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1808049,00.html">130k 2010 USD / year</a>. So how cheap can we make the AGI / robot human equivalent / year for a given task?</p>

<p>AGI + humanoid robots likely implies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover">AI takeover</a> though. It would then come down to human loving bots vs human hating bots fighting it out. It will be both terrifying and fun to watch.</p>

<p>AGI alone would be very dangerous, in case it can get control of our nuclear arsenals through software zero days or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29">social engineering</a>. Although some <a href="https://www.quora.com/Could-a-group-of-hackers-break-into-military-networks-and-launch-or-detonate-nuclear-missiles">claim that is unlikely</a>.</p>
