# TODO

-   Make tables and code blocks show scrollbar when screen is small.

    Currently:

    - some tables overflow (e.g. skills page)
    - code blocks wrap

    Even better on mobile: allow user to drag slide anywhere on over the code block.

-   Make headings smaller on mobile.

-   Fix issue link under `web`: links to `web` but should be `web-cheat`.
